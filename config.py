# TODO: Important: Add multiprocessing to lattice generator to compute the mutual information.
# TODO: Think about how to create formulas / play with parameters so that there arenâ€™t many groups that have high mutual
#  information. Obviously in notebook.
# TODO: Check if mutual information can be computed on the GPU.
# TODO: Think about how we can add noise for different subgroups in the synthetic data.
