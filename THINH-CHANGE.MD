List of changes that I made


1. modify the command line argument parser: instead of using --dataset_path or --dir_path 
   now just need to use --data_name=synthetic (or `loan`, `startup`, `mobile`)

2. name conventions to make our lives easier:
    - for node index, use `nid`
    - for subgroup index, use `gid`
    - for feature index, use `fid`

3. restricted graph: not only upper bounded, but also lower bounded
   therefore, the relevant nodes should have:  min_level <= count('1') <= max_level
   I have modified this in the code

4. modify `utils::read_paths(args)`, make it easier to use

5. `missing_data_masking::_get_random_missing_indices_dict()` 
    I introduce a "counts" hashmap, to count the missing frequency of each feature
    to make sure a feature is **NOT** missing across all subgroups

6. I think we should not load `pipeline_obj` from disk to avoid bugs right now
   we can modify code to load it for inference, right now perhaps just comment it out

7. modify `sampler::randwalk()` to "walk" within min and max level
